Howdy, I am Nick and I am working on creating a arduino library to run my 8x6 LED Array off of, I want to expand the library to support any size array, and potentially 3d projects such as LED cubes.
Stay tuned for more progess on this, but please keep in mind that I am an EE student who has completed all his programming classes and doesn't have much time to work on a project like this.
